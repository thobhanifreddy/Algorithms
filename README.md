# Algorithms

Currently, implementation of all algorithms is in C.
Feel free to add implementations in other programming languages or even improve any of the existing code. 

## Future Plans

When we will have implementations in multiple languages we can make a folder of each algorithm with Pseudo code and analysis in one file and implementation in respective files. 

## code of conduct

- The code should be simple to understand. 
    - You can make existing such that it will be easier to understand.  You can also achieve this by adding comments, improving variables name or improving the code.
